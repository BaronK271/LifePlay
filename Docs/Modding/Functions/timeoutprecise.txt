timeoutPrecise(hours, sceneid1, sceneid2, ..., sceneidN)

Timeout these scenes for x hours so that they won't trigger again. The number of hours is fixed and not affected by the scene frequency setting.

Example:
    "I just celebrated my birthday."
    timeoutPrecise(8760, birthday)  // it will be my birthday again exactly this time next year
