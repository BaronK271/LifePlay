Actor.blendPreset(PresetID)

Blend this actor with a preset, usually called after generatePerson().

EXAMPLE:
    // We want a male bodybuilder
    Bodybuilder = generatePerson()  // just so that we get the random stats etc, but this might generate a female
    Bodybuilder.blendPreset(bodybuilder)  // if the above is female, then this will reset face and hair to the default male face and hair
    Actor.randomizeFace()
    Actor.randomizeHairs()
