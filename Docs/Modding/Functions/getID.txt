Actor.getID() returns Float

Get the ID of this actor, which can then be saved as a global variable and then called on using getSpecific.

EXAMPLE:
    ID = Actor.getID()
    SugarDaddy.setGlobal(ID)
    
    // another scene
    
    ID = SugarDaddy.getID()
    If ID != 0
        Actor = getSpecific(ID)
