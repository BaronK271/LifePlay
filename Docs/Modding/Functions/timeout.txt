timeout(hours, sceneid1, sceneid2, ..., sceneidN)

Timeout these scenes for x hours so that they won't trigger again. The number of hours is adjusted by the scene frequency setting however.

Example:
    "I just met someone. I don't want to meet another person for a while."
    timeout(20, meet_new_person)  // could be more or less than 20 hours depending on the scene frequency setting
