generatePerson() returns Actor
generatePerson(preset1, preset2, ..., presetN) returns Actor

Generate a new actor. If nothing inside the bracket: completely random actor. Or you can specify the presets to blend into this new actor. The actor generated using this method will be permanent right away, meaning they will remain (as a lpcharacter ready to be 'get' for a future scene) after the current scene ends.

EXAMPLE:
    Actor = generatePerson()  // OR Actor = generatePerson(easterneuropean, twenties, fitness_model)
    Actor.dress()
    Actor.show(2)
    
    exchangeContact(Actor) // this will succeed because this is a permanent actor
