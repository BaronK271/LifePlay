All mods you make for this game, even if using LifePlay scripting language or the game's built-in editor functions, completely belong to YOU the modder. You can do whatever you want with these mods (they're yours!), even commercially.
However, I do not endorse and am not responsible for any mods made by a third party that might be illegal in their jurisdiction, including but not limited to sexual despiction of minors.
